## SECTION 4: RISK MANAGEMENT FEATURES

### Real-Time Risk Calculations

**1. Portfolio Beta**:

* Measures portfolio volatility vs. market
* Formula: Weighted average of all holding betas

* Uses last 30 days of data
* Higher volatility = higher risk
* Example: 18.5% = moderate risk profile

**3. Maximum Drawdown**:

* Worst peak-to-trough loss %
* Shows portfolio resilience in downturns
* Example: -15.3% = worst loss from peak

**4. Sharpe Ratio**:

* Return per unit of risk
* Formula: (Return - Risk-free Rate) / Volatility
* Good: >1.0 | Excellent: >2.0 | Great: >3.0

**5. Win Rate**:

* % of closed positions with profit
* Tracks trading success rate
* Updated as each position closes
